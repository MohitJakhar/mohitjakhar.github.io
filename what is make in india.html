            <p align="center" margin="200px" style="font-size:36px; color:#FFF" > The Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi has launched an initiative <br> named Make in India on 25th of September, 2014 in New Delhi. The aim of this campaign <br> is to provide India an economic global recognition. While launching the programme,<br>  PM said that investors should take it as an opportunity and not as market in India. <br> This campaign aimed to renew an Indian economy from services-driven growth model to the labour-intensive <br> manufacturing-driven growth. A successful implementation of the programme will be the reason <br> of employment for more than 10 million people in India. This is an effective plan which <br> will attract top foreign companies to set up their business here in India.

<br> In order to attract foreign capital, there has been made huge changes in the defense manufacturing and insurance sectors<br> , however according to the analyst it needs to do in more effective manner. More employment in the country <br> will boost the purchasing power of common man. India is a country having unique combination of demography,<br>  democracy, and demand which can benefit the investors.

<br> Because of the lack of resources and clarity on policy issues, Indian businessmen too were planning to <br> quit India and set up their business somewhere else. If this happen, will cause more poor economy. <br> Make in India campaign with various effective resources will draw the attention <br> of worldwide top businessmen to invest in India for any related business.<br>  In order to avoid the compulsion of Indian businesses to another country, PM has launched this attractive plan.<br>  The dream of PM Narendra Modi

is to make <br> this country free of unemployment by bringing development and growth-oriented employment through <br> his effective governance. Poverty in India can be reduced to a great level by solving the <br> unemployment issue for youths which in turn may solve various social issues.<br> </p>
