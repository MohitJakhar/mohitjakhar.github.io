            The Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi has launched an initiative named Make in India on 25th of September, 2014 in New Delhi. The aim of this campaign is to provide India an economic global recognition. While launching the programme, PM said that investors should take it as an opportunity and not as market in India.

<p div id="box2" class="w3-container w3-center w3-animate-opacity" >what does it aim for?
            <br />
            <br />
            This campaign aimed to renew an Indian economy from services-driven growth model to the labour-intensive manufacturing-driven growth. A successful implementation of the programme will be the reason of employment for more than 10 million people in India. This is an effective plan which will attract top foreign companies to set up their business here in India

<p div id="box3" class="w3-container w3-center w3-animate-opacity" >Why was it setup? 

            <br />
            <br />
           Because of the lack of resources and clarity on policy issues, Indian businessmen too were planning to quit India and set up their business somewhere else. If this happen, will cause more poor economy. Make in India campaign with various effective resources will draw the attention of worldwide top businessmen to invest in India for any related business. In order to avoid the compulsion of Indian businesses to another country, PM has launched this attractive plan. The dream of PM Narendra Modi
